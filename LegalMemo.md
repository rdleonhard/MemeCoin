# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose of the Memorandum

This legal memorandum aims to establish that **Meme Coin**, an ERC20 token issued on Uniswap V2, does not constitute a security under U.S. law. By addressing key components of the Howey Test, namely the lack of a common enterprise and the absence of a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the managerial efforts of others, we argue that Meme Coin falls outside the legal definition of a security.

## 1.2. Brief Overview of Meme Coin

**Meme Coin** is a token launched on the Ethereum blockchain, adhering to the ERC20 standard. After issuance on Uniswap V2, the token's developers took a hands-off approach, refraining from any further development or direct control of the token. The future of Meme Coin is entirely dependent on its community and market dynamics.

# 2. Legal Framework

## 2.1. Definition of a Security

In the United States, the definition of a "security" is derived from the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which include an "investment contract" within their definition of a security. The definition of an investment contract has been further refined through case law, most notably SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.

## 2.2. The Howey Test for Investment Contracts

The Supreme Court in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co. established the "Howey Test" to determine whether a transaction constitutes an investment contract and, therefore, a security. According to the Howey Test, an investment contract exists when there is (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with a reasonable expectation of profits, (4) derived from the managerial efforts of others.

# 3. Application to Meme Coin

## 3.1. Common Enterprise

A common enterprise typically refers to a venture in which the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with those of either the promoter or a third party. In the case of **Meme Coin**, once issued on Uniswap V2, the issuers had no further involvement in its development or control. Therefore, there is no common enterprise as the fortunes of Meme Coin holders are not tied to the efforts of the issuers or any third party.

## 3.2. Reasonable Expectation of Profits

The expectation of profits is typically associated with a passive investment where returns are produced by the efforts of others. **Meme Coin**, however, provides no such expectation. It was issued with the clear understanding that there will be no further development or managerial efforts from the issuers. Thus, any potential increase in value cannot be attributed to the efforts of the promoters but is solely due to market forces.

## 3.3. Profits from Managerial Efforts of Others

The issuers of **Meme Coin** have explicitly stepped away from any further development or control over the token post-issuance. This means that holders of Meme Coin cannot expect profits resulting from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of the issuers or any third party. Any potential profits would be exclusively the result of market dynamics and the individual efforts of token holders.

# 4. Comparison with Relevant Cases

## 4.1. SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.

In SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., the Supreme Court held that an investment contract, hence a security, exists when there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. In the case of **Meme Coin**, as we have established, there is no common enterprise, nor is there a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others, distinguishing it from the investment contracts scrutinized in Howey.

## 4.2. SEC v. Unikrn Inc.

In SEC v. Unikrn Inc., the SEC alleged that Unikrn's initial coin offering constituted unregistered securities because buyers had a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of Unikrn. Unlike Unikrn, **Meme Coin's** issuers do not participate in any further development, control, or promotion of the token post-issuance. Therefore, there can be no expectation of profit derived from the efforts of the issuers, setting it apart from the Unikrn case.

## 4.3. Other relevant case law

(Here you could discuss any other relevant cases that have helped shape the legal understanding of what constitutes a security within the cryptocurrency context, comparing and contrasting them with **Meme Coin** to further your argument.)

# 5. Conclusion

## 5.1. Summary of Analysis

We have analyzed **Meme Coin** under the Howey Test for investment contracts and concluded that it does not meet the criteria to be considered a security. Specifically, Meme Coin does not involve a common enterprise and does not offer a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the managerial efforts of others.

## 5.2. Final Determination

Given the above analysis, we argue that **Meme Coin** does not constitute a security under U.S. law. However, it is important to note that the final determination may ultimately rest with regulatory authorities or courts. This memorandum serves as a legal argument based on the currently available information and existing regulatory framework.
